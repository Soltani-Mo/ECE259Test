\problem{\textit{Magnetic vector potential of a straight wire conductor.} A steady current is established in a straight metallic wire conductor in a nonmagnetic medium. The magnetic vector potential due to this current at an arbitrary point in space that is not on the wire axis is
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item Parallel to the wire.
\item Perpendicular to the wire.
\item None of the above.
\item Depends on the particular position of the point with respect to the wire.
