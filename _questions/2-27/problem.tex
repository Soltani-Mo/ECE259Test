\problem{\textit{Change of capacitor energy due to change of dielectric}. The dielectric in a spherical capacitor is oil. The capacitor is connected to a voltage source. The source is then disconnected and the oil is drained from the capacitor. The energy of the capacitor in the final electrostatic state is
