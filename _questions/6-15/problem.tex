\problem{\textit{Induced emf and electric field along an imaginary contour}. If the loop in Fig.~Q6.4 is an imaginary (nonmaterial) contour, in place of a conducting wire loop, which of the two quantities, the induced electromotive force ($e_\mathrm{ind}$) and induced electric field intensity ($E_\mathrm{ind}$), along the contour remain the same as along the conducting wire?
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item $e_\mathrm{ind}$ only.
\item $E_\mathrm{ind}$ only.
\item {Both quantities.}
\item None of the quantities.
\end{enumerate}}
