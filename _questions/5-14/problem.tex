\problem{\textit{Increasing current of a coil over a toroidal magnetic core.} In the structure in Fig.Q5.6, a coil of wire is wound uniformly and densely about a thin toroidal magnetic core. The current of the coil is $I$, and the magnetic field intensity and flux density in the core are $H$ and $B$, respectively. If $I$ is doubled,

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item both $H$ and $B$ double as well.
\item $H$ doubles and $B$ remains approximately the same.
\item $H$ remains approximately the same and $B$ doubles.
\item $H$ doubles and $B$ increases by about $50\%$.
\item None of the above.
\item {Need more information.}
