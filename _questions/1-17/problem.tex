\problem{\textit{Electric field due to a uniformly charged spherical
		surface.}
Consider a sphere of radius $a$ that is uniformly charged over its surface
with a total charge $Q$, and is situated in free space. The electric field intensity
vector at a point whose radial distance from the sphere center is $r$ is the same as $\vect{E}$
due to a point charge placed at the sphere center for the following range of values
of $r$ only:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item $a < r < \infty$.
\item $r\gg a$.
\item $0 < r < \infty$.
\item $0 < r < a$.
\item never (for none of the possible values of r).


\end{enumerate}
