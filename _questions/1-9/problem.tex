\problem{\textit{Potential and voltages for a new reference point.}
What happens to electric potentials and voltages in an electrostatic system after a new reference point is adopted for the potential?
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item Both potentials and voltages change by the same value.
\item Potentials become zero and voltages remain unchanged.
\item Both potentials and voltages remain unchanged.
\item {Potentials change by the same value and voltages remain unchanged.}
\item Potentials remain unchanged and voltages change by the same value.
