\problem{\textit{Same contour inside different conductors.} Consider two very long metallic conductors, one of a circular and the other of square cross section. Both conductors carry steady currents of the same density. If the same circular contour $C$ is positioned inside each of the conductor, as in Fig.~Q4.6, the circulation of the magnetic flux density vector along $C$ in the circular conductor is
