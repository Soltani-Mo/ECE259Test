\problem{\textit{Open-circuited loop around a solenoid}. An air-filled infinitely long solenoidal coil with a circular cross section of radius $a$ carries a slowly time-varying current. The magnetic flux through a surface spanned over one turn of the coil is $\Phi(t)$. An open-circuited circular wire loop of radius $b$ ($b>a$) is placed coaxially around the solenoid, as shown in Fig.Q6.4. The voltage between the terminals of the loop, for the reference orientation of the terminals in the figure, equals
