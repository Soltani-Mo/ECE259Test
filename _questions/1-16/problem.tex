\problem{\textit{Introducing a point charge near a Gaussian surface.}
A spherical surface S is placed in free space concentrically with another sphere that
is uniformly charged over its volume, and the radius of S is larger than that of
the charged sphere. Then, a point charge $Q$, where $Q$ equals the total charge of
the sphere, is introduced in the system as in Fig.Q1.12. Let~$\Psi_E$ and $E$ denote the outward flux of the electric field intensity vector through S and the electric field
intensity at the point A in the figure, respectively. Which of the two quantities
change their value after the point charge is introduced?
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item $\Psi_E$ only.
\item $E$ only.
\item Both quantities
\item None of the quantities.
