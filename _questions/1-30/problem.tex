\problem{\textit{Image theory for a line charge parallel to a corner screen.} 
Illustrated in the figure below is the application of image theory to a line charge of density $Q'$ in the presence of a
90 $^0$ corner metallic screen in air. The densities of the three image line charges in the figure are: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item {$Q'_1 = Q'_2  = - Q'$ and $Q'_3 = Q'$. }
\item $Q'_1= Q'_2 = Q'_3 = - Q'$.
\item $Q'_1 = Q'_2 = Q'$ and $Q'_3 = - Q'$. 
\item $Q'_1 = Q'_3 = - Q'$ and $Q'_2 = Q'$. 
\item $Q'_1 = Q'_2 = - Q'$ and $Q'_3 = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
