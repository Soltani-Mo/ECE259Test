\problem{\textit{Wider strip conductor (longer cavity).} Consider the folded strip conductor from the previous question, and assume that $a$ is made twice larger, while keeping $I$ and $d$ the same. The magnitude of the $\vec{B}$ field at the point $P$ in the modified structure is
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item considerably larger than
\item {considerably smaller than}
\item practically the same as
