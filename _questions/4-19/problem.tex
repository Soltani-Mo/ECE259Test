\problem{\textit{Magnetic flux through a conical surface.} Consider an imaginary open conical surface in a uniform steady magnetic field of flux density B = 1 T. The height (length) of the cone is $h = 20\cm$ and the radius of its opening is $a = 10\cm$. The vector $\vect{B}$ makes an angle $\alpha = 45^0$ with the cone axis as in Fig.Q4.12. If $h$ is doubled (without changing a, $B$, and $\alpha$), the magnetic flux through the conical surface (oriented downward)
