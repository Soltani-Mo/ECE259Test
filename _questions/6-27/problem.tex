\problem{\textit{Ferromagnetic core of an ac machine.} Consider a ferromagnetic (e.g. iron) core of an ac machine or transformer made of mutually insulated stacked thin plates, shown in Fig.~Q6.11(a), and a core made of a single piece of material, shown in Fig.~Q6.11(b), and compare the respective distributions of the time-harmonic magnetic field in the two cases. The magnetic flux is more uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the core (or over its cross section) for 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item {case (a)}.
\item case (b).
\item No noticeable difference between the two cases.
