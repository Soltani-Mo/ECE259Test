\problem{\textit{Divergence-free and/or curl-free vector fields.} Consider the field pattern (showing lines of a vector field $\vec{a}$ in a part of free space) in Fig.~Q4.11(a) and that in Fig.~Q4.11(b), and whether each of the fields is divergence-free ($\nabla \cdot \vec{a} = 0$) and/or curl-free ($\nabla \times \vec{a} = 0$). Which of the following statements is true?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item {Field in Fig.~Q4.11(a) is divergence-free and field in Fig.~Q4.11(b) is curl-free.}
\item Field in Fig.~Q4.11(a) is curl-free and field in Fig.~Q4.11(b) is divergence-free.
\item Both fields are divergence-free and none of the fields is curl-free.
\item Both fields are curl-free and none of the fields is divergence-free.
\item None of the fields is divergence-free nor curl-free.
