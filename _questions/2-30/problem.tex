\problem{\textit{Change of field intensity/flux density and energy}. Two capacitors contain the same amount of electric energy. If the electric field intensity ($\vec{E}$) at every point in the first capacitor becomes twice larger, while the electric flux density ($\vec{D}$) at every point in the second capacitor is halved, the energy stored in the first capacitor in the new electrostatic state is
