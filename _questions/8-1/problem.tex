\problem{\textit{Closed path in a high-frequency electromagnetic field.} A high-frequency time-harmonic electromagnetic field exist in a lossy medium. The current density vector in the medium is $\vec{J}$, the electric flux density vector is $\vec{D}$, and the magnetic flux density vector is $\vec{B}$. The line integral of the magnetic field intensity vector $\vec{H}$, along an arbitrary planar contour (closed path) in the medium equals to the flux of the following vector through a flat surface spanned over the contour:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item $\vec{J}$,
\item $\vec{B}$,
\item $\frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t}$,
\item {$\vec{J} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t}$},
\item $-\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$,
\end{enumerate}
where the orientation of the contour and the orientation of the surface are adopted in accordance to the right-hand rule.}
