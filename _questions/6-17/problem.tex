\problem{\textit{Moving line - closed/open, imaginary/conducting.} Fig.~Q6.5 portrays four cases of either a (closed) contour or open line (with two ends) that are either imaginary (nonmaterial) or made of a metallic wire - moving uniformly with a velocity $\vect{v}$ in a time-invariant (static) magnetic field of flux density $\vect{B}$, in a vacuum. For a specific orientation in space of the vector $\vect{B}$, it is possible for an emf to be induced ($e_\mathrm{ind} \ne 0$) along the contour/line in
