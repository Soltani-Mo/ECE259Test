\problem{\textit{Magnetic field due to volume currents}. Consider an arbitrary distribution of volume currents in a vacuum and the magnetic flux density vector due to these currents at an arbitrary point in space. If the magnitude of the current density vector is doubled everywhere, the magnetic flux density vector consider
