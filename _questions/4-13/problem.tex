\problem{\textit{Folded metallic strip with current.} As insulated metallic strip folded as in Fig.~Q4.9 carries a steady current of intensity $I$. The width of the strip is $a = 20d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the cylindrical cavity formed by the strip. With this, the magnitude of the $\vec{B}$ field at the point $P$ inside the cavity (see the figure) is
