\problem{\textit{Induced emf and electric field along a circular loop.} Consider the induced electromotive force, $e_\mathrm{ind}$, and induced electric field intensity, $E_\mathrm{ind}$, along the loop in Fig.Q6.4. If the radius of the loop is doubled (becomes $2b$), while both $a$ and $\Phi(t)$ are not changed, we have that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item both $e_\mathrm{ind}$ and $E_\mathrm{ind}$ double.
\item both $e_\mathrm{ind}$ and $E_\mathrm{ind}$ remain the same.
\item both $e_\mathrm{ind}$ and $E_\mathrm{ind}$ are halved.
\item {$e_\mathrm{ind}$ remains the same and $E_\mathrm{ind}$ is halved}.
\item $e_\mathrm{ind}$ doubles and $E_\mathrm{ind}$ remains the same.
\end{enumerate}}
