\problem{\textit{Conductor with two parts of different conductivities}. A conductor is composed from two homogeneous pieces of the same size but of different conductivities $\sigma_1 \neq \sigma_2$. In case (a), the pieces are connected one along the other [Fig.~Q3.5(a)]. In case (b), they are connected one behind the other [Fig.~Q.3.5(b)]. If a time-invariant current density $I$ is made to flow through the conductor the current density vectors in the two pieces are the same ($\vec{J}_1 = \vec{J}_2$) for
