\problem{
\textit{Uniformly polarized large dielectric slab, field inside.} An infinitely large dielectric slab of thickness $d = 2a$ is uniformly polarized through-out its volume such that the polarization vector, $\vect{P}$, is perpendicular to the faces (boundary surfaces) of the slab, as shown in Fig.~Q2.2. The surrounding medium is air. The electric field intensity vector (due to bound charges of the slab) at a point inside the slab is
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item nonzero and has the same direction as $\vect{P}$.
\item {nonzero and is directed oppositely to $\vect{P}$.}
\item zero.
\end{enumerate}
