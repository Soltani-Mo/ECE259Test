\problem{\textit{Change of dielectric with a source connected}. An air-filled parallel-plate capacitor is attached to a voltage source. While the source is still connected, the space between the plates is completely filled by a dielectric slab ($\varepsilon_r = 2$). In the new electrostatic state, the electric field intensity is
