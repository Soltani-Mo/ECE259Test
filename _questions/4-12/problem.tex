\problem{\textit{Magnetic field in the inner conductor of a coaxial cable.} For the coaxial cable from the previous question, assume that the current intensity in the outer conductor is decreased, while keeping the current in the inner conductor unchanged. As a result, the magnetic flux density at every point of the inner conductor (not considering the points at the conductor axis)
