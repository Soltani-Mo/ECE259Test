\problem{\textit{Decreasing current of a coil over an iron core.} Let the core in Fig.Q5.6 be cut from iron and the current $I$ of the coil be established at a very large (positive) value. If $I$ is then reduced to zero, the values of the magnetic field intensity ($H$) and flux density ($B$) in the core encounter the following changes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item Both $H$ and $B$ drop to zero.
\item $H$ drops to zero and $B$ retains its starting (saturation) value.
\item $H$ retains its saturation value and $B$ drops to zero.
\item {$H$ drops to zero and $B$ drops to a nonzero value.}
\item $H$ drops to a nonzero value and $B$ drops to zero.
\item Both $H$ and $B$ drop but not to zero.
\end{enumerate}}
