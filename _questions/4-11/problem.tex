\problem{\textit{Magnetic field in the outer conductor of a coaxial cable.} The inner and outer conductors of a coaxial cable carry steady currents of the same intensity and opposite directions. The cable dielectric and conductors are nonmagnetic, and the surrounding medium is air. If the current intensity in the inner conductor is increased, while keeping the current in the outer conductor unchanged, the magnetic flux density at every point of the outer conductor
