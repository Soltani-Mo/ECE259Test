\problem{\textit{Eddy currents in a rotating cylinder.} A very long conducting cylinder of radius $a$ uniformly rotates with angular velocity $\omega$ about its axis in a uniform time-invariant magnetic field of flux density $\vect{B}$, as depicted in Fig.~Q6.12. Streamlines of eddy currents inside the cylinder away from its ends (bases) are 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item circular (circles centered at the cylinder axis).
\item radial (with respect to the cylinder axis).
\item {axial (parallel to the cylinder axis)}.
\item nonexistent (eddy currents are not induced in this case).
\end{enumerate}
