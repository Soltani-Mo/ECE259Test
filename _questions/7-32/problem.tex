\problem{\textit{Energy spent in magnetization-demagnetization.} In two equally sized pieces of different ferromagnetic materials, a uniform magnetic field is first established, at the same intensity ($H_m$), and then reduced to zero ($H = 0$), during which process the operating point describes the respective paths shown in Fig.Q7.10. The net magnetic energy spent in the magnetization-demagnetization of the piece in case(a) is
