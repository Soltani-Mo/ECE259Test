\problem{\textit{Zero potential and/or field at a point.}
Consider an
electrostatic field in a region of space and the following two statements: (a) If the
electric scalar potential at a point in the region is zero, then the electric field vector
at that point must be zero as well; (b) If the electric field vector at a point is zero,
then the potential at the same point must be zero. Which of the statements is true?
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item Statement (a) only.
\item Statement (b) only.
\item Both statements.
\item None of the statements.
