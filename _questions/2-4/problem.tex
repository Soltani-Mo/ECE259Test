%\itemi{Question 2.4 (Notaros) 
\problem{\textit{Flux of the electric field vector around a polarized body.} Consider a polarized dielectric body with no free charge, in free space. The outward flux of the electric field intensity vector, $\vect{E}$, through a closed surface S that completely encloses the body is
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item positive.
\item {zero.}
\item negative.
\item Depends on whether the dielectric is homogeneous or not.
\item Depends on the distribution of the polarization vector in the body.
