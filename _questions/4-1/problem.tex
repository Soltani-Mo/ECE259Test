\problem{\textit{Point charge moving near a wire current conductor}. A point charge $Q$ is moving in the air with a velocity $\vec{v}$ near a straight wire conductor with a time-invariant current of intensity $I$. Referring to three cases with different directions of $\vec{v}$ shown in Fig.~Q4.1, the magnetic force on $Q$ is zero for
