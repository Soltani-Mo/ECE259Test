	\problem{\textit{Two parallel strips with equal surface charge densities.}
		Two parallel, infinite long strips of width~$a$ are uniformly charged with equal charge densities~$\rho_s(\rho_s>0)$, and a cross section of the structure is shown in Fig.Q1.5. The ambient medium is air, and the separation between strips is~$d$. The resultant electric field intensity vector~$\vec{E}$ at the point M in the figure
