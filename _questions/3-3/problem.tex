\problem{\textit{Power of Joule's losses in two steady states. } 
The power of Joule's losses in two conductors appears to be the same. If the current density at every point in the first conductor becomes twice larger, while the electric field intensity at every point in the second conductor is halved, the power of Jouleâ€™s losses in the first conductor in the new steady state is:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item 1/4 of 
\item 1/16 of 
\item 4 times
\item {16 times}
\end{enumerate}
that in the second conductor.}
