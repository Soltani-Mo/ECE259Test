\problem{\textit{Energies of two inductors with the same magnetic flux.} Two linear inductors of inductances $L$ and $2L$, respectively, have the same magnetic flux, $\Phi$. The magnetic energy stored in the inductor with twice as large inductance is
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item twice
\item four times
\item {a half of}
\item a quarter of
\item the same as
