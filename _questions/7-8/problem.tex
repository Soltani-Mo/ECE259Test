\problem{\textit{Doubling the number of wire turns in a coil.} A coil with $N$ turns of wire is wound uniformly and densely about a thin toroidal core made from a linear ferromagnetic material of relative permeability $\mu_r$. Consider the magnetic flux density, $B$, inside the core and inductance, $L$, of the coil. If the diameter of the wire in the coil is halved and $N$ is doubled, while the current $I$ in the coil is kept the same, we have that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item both $B$ and $L$ double.
\item both $B$ and $L$ remain the same.
\item both $B$ and $L$ quadruple.
\item {$B$ doubles and $L$ quadruples.}
\item $B$ remains the same and $L$ quadruples.
\item $B$ remains the same and $L$ is halved.
\end{enumerate}}
