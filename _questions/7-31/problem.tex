\problem{\textit{Change of magnetic field intensity/flux density and energy.} Two linear inductors contain the same amounts of magnetic energy. If the magnetic field intensity ($H$) at every point in the first inductor becomes twice larger, while the magnetic flux density ($B$) at every point in the second inductor is halved, the energy stored in the first inductor in the new steady state is
