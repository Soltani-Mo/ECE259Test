\problem{\textit{Coaxial cable with a radial variation of permittivity}. A coaxial cable is filled with a continuously inhomogeneous dielectric and connected to voltage source. The permittivity of the dielectric is a function of the radial distance $r$ from the cables axis and no other coordinates. Consider vectors $\vec{D}$ and $\vec{E}$ in the cable. The way in which each of the vector varies throughout the dielectric is the same as in the same cable if air-filled for
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
\item both vectors.
\item {vector $\vec{D}$ only.}
\item vector $\vec{E}$ only.
\item None of the vectors.
