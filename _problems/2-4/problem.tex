\problem{Two point charges $Q_1 = 7\uC$, and $Q_2 = -3\uC$, are located on two non-adjacent vertices of a square contour $a=15\cm$ on a side. Find the voltage between any of the remaining two vertices of the square and the square center.}

\solution {If we look at the figure below, we are trying to find the voltage of $A$ with respect to $B$ or $V_{AB}$. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4] {\ppath Q4.jpg}
\end{center}
This can be done by finding the absolute voltages at $A$ and $B$ and then subtracting them. More specifically,
\begin{align*}
V_{AB}&=V_A-V_B\\
V_{AB}&=\left(\frac{Q_1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a}+\frac{Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a}\right) - \left( \frac{Q_1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a\sqrt{2}/2}+\frac{Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a\sqrt{2}/2}\right)\\
V_{AB}&=-99.27 \textrm{kV}
\end{align*}
The voltage of the other vertex with respect to the center would be identical.
}

\answer {$-99.27$\,kV}
