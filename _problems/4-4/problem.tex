\problem{[Cheng P.3-41] Einstein's theory of relativity stipulates that the work required to assemble a charge is stored as energy in the mass and is equal to $mc^2$, where $m$ is the mass, and $c\approxeq 3\times 10^8$ ($m/s$) is the velocity of light. Assuming the electron is a perfect sphere, find its radius from its charge and mass ($9.31\times 10^{31}$ kg).}

\solution{
From Eq. (3-169), $W = \dfrac{3 e^2}{20\pi \varepsilon_0 b} 
= mc^2$\; and \;$b = \dfrac{3 e^2}{20 \pi \varepsilon_0 mc^2}
= 1.69 \times 10^{-15}\m$}

\answer{
$b =1.69 \times 10^{-15}\m$}
